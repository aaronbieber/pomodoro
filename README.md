# Pomodoro

This is an extremely simple Pomodoro timer for Windows 10, written in Visual 
Studio with the Windows Presentation Framework.

I just wanted a timer with a scalable window and a dark theme that supports 
the essential, simple pomodoro routine and doesn't get in your face. There is 
virtually no customizability by design.

## Building

Choose Release and click Build. I probably can't help you solve build problems 
because I barely know what I'm doing in the first place.

## Usage

There are four buttons on the interface:

 * Play/pause: Start or pause your pomodoro session
 * "Previous": Return to the start of the current pomodoro segment (either 
   "pomodoro" or "break") and pause
 * "Fast forward": Skip to the next pomodoro segment
 * Gear: Change the two pomodoro segment durations, which are always in 
   minutes
